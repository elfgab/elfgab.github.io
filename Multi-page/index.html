            <h1>Finish the Fight</h1>
            <p>Halo 3 concludes the original story arc of the Human-Covenant war. The game opens with Master Chief crash-landing in an African jungle on Earth after the events of Halo 2. He is found by Sergeant Johnson and the Arbiter, a former Covenant Elite who is now allied with humanity.

            The primary conflict revolves around the Covenant's leader, the High Prophet of Truth, who has come to Earth to activate a massive Forerunner artifact. This artifact opens a portal to the Ark, a colossal installation outside the Milky Way galaxy where the entire Halo array can be fired remotely. The Covenant believes this will start the "Great Journey" and lead them to salvation, but it would actually wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy.

            As the human and Elite forces follow Truth through the portal to the Ark, the parasitic Flood also arrives, crashing their infected city-ship High Charity onto the installation. This creates a three-way battle between the UNSC-Elite alliance, the Covenant loyalists, and the Flood.

            The climax of the game involves Master Chief and the Arbiter fighting their way to the Ark's control room to stop Truth. After a major battle, the Arbiter kills Truth, but 343 Guilty Spark, the AI monitor, reveals that the Ark is building a new Halo ring to replace one that Master Chief previously destroyed. To eradicate the Flood threat for good, Master Chief decides to activate this new, unstable Halo, which will destroy the Ark and all Flood forces present.

            In the final sequence, Master Chief and the Arbiter activate the ring and escape on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn. The ship is torn in half during the escape. The Arbiter makes it back to Earth, but Master Chief and his AI companion, Cortana, are left adrift in the unknown reaches of space, with the Chief entering cryo-sleep to await rescue.</p>
